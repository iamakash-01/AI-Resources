Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds\nor on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of September 30, 2021\nand December 31, 2020, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note\nhedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.\nConcentration of Risk: Supply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our\nproducts in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these\nsuppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n'''\n\ntext3 = '''Tesla's gross cost of operating lease vehicles in FY2021 Q1 was $4.85 billion.\nBMW's gross cost of operating vehicles in FY2021 S1 was $8 billion.'''","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.147988Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.148369Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.153594Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.148340Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.152287Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# extracting twitter handles from the above text\npattern = 'https://twitter\\.com.([a-zA-Z_0-9]+)'\nresult = re.findall(pattern, text1)\nprint(result)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.867088Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.867473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.873632Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.867443Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-16T04:45:02.872453Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"['elonmusk', 'teslarati', 'dummy_tesla', 'dummy_2_tesla']\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# extracting concentrating risks\npattern = 'Risk:(.*)'\nresult = re.findall(pattern,text2)\nprint(result)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.373193Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.373531Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.379219Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.373506Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.377995Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[' Credit Risk', ' Supply Risk']\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# extracting the quarterly period\npattern = 'FY(\\d{4} (?:Q[1-2]|S[1-2]))'\nresult = re.findall(pattern, text3)\nprint(result)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.380742Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.381157Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.397836Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.381115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-16T04:45:03.396739Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"['2021 Q1', '2021 S1']\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":23}]}
